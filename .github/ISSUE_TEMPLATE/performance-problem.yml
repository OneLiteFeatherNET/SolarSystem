        Run `/about SolarSystem` on your server and **paste** the full, unmodified output here.
        "latest" is *not* a version; we require the output of `/about SolarSystem` so we can adequately track down the issue.
        Additionally, do NOT provide a screenshot, you MUST paste the entire output.
